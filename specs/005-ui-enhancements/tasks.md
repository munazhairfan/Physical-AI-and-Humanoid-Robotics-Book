# Tasks for UI/UX Design Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `005-ui-enhancements` | **Date**: 2025-12-11 | **Spec**: D:/AI/Hackathon-I/Physical-AI-and-Humanoid-Robotics/specs/005-ui-enhancements/spec.md
**Plan**: D:/AI/Hackathon-I/Physical-AI-and-Humanoid-Robotics/specs/005-ui-enhancements/plan.md

## Summary
This document outlines the detailed, actionable tasks for developing specification content for UI/UX design enhancements, following the content requirements specified in `spec.md` and `plan.md`.

## Implementation Strategy
The implementation will follow an MVP-first approach, focusing on delivering core content for User Story 1, then progressively adding practical examples, and cross-cutting concerns. Each user story will be developed as an independently testable increment.

## Phase 1: Setup - Project Initialization
- [ ] T001 Initialize specification project structure
- [ ] T002 Set up research environment for UI/UX design

## Phase 2: Foundational - Core Content Structure
- [ ] T003 Create core specification sections with proper structure
- [ ] T004 Document design principles and guidelines
- [ ] T005 Document UI patterns for technical applications

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Learning UI/UX Fundamentals for Technical Systems (P1)
**Goal**: User can identify core HRI principles, understand UI/UX differences for technical applications, implement basic control interfaces, and create real-time data visualizations.

**Independent Test Criteria**: All content pages for UI/UX fundamentals are generated, formatted correctly, include explanations, React/TypeScript code examples where applicable.

- [ ] T006 [US1] Add "What constitutes effective UI/UX in technical applications" content
- [ ] T007 [US1] Add "Comparison: Traditional web UI → Specialized technical UI" content
- [ ] T008 [US1] Add "Real-world applications" content
- [ ] T009 [US1] Add "UI/UX in safety-critical systems" content
- [ ] T010 [US1] Add "Human-computer interaction (HCI) principles" content
- [ ] T011 [US1] Add "Cognitive load management in technical interfaces" overview
- [ ] T012 [US1] Add "Visual hierarchy for complex data" explanation
- [ ] T013 [US1] Add "Color theory for industrial applications" explanation
- [ ] T014 [US1] Add "Typography in technical interfaces" explanation
- [ ] T015 [US1] Add "Micro-interactions and feedback systems" explanation
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add "Control panel design" patterns with React/TypeScript example
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add "Status monitoring displays" patterns with React/TypeScript example
- [ ] T018 [P] [US1] Document dashboard implementation with step-by-step instructions and React/TypeScript code
- [ ] T019 [US1] Add "Data visualization techniques" explanation with basic example
- [ ] T020 [US1] Add "Multi-modal interface design" explanation with basic example
- [ ] T021 [US1] Add "Error handling and safety indicators" explanation and example
- [ ] T022 [US1] Add "Real-time performance dashboards" explanation and example
- [ ] T023 [P] [US1] Document control interface with step-by-step instructions and React/TypeScript code
- [ ] T024 [US1] Add "React/TypeScript component architecture" explanation and example
- [ ] T025 [P] [US1] Document data visualization with step-by-step instructions and React/TypeScript code
- [ ] T026 [US1] Add "Real-time data visualization with D3.js" explanation and example
- [ ] T027 [US1] Add "State management for complex interfaces" explanation and example
- [ ] T028 [US1] Add "Performance optimization for data-heavy displays" explanation and example
- [ ] T029 [US1] Add "Accessibility compliance (WCAG standards)" explanation and example
- [ ] T030 [US1] Add "Responsive design for different device sizes" explanation and example

## Phase 4: Final Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
- [ ] T031 Review all specification files for proper structure, learning objectives, and code/explanation.
- [ ] T032 Validate all code examples are runnable and produce expected outputs.
- [ ] T033 Review the overall tone and style of the specification content to ensure it is balanced, beginner-friendly, intuitive, and accurate.
- [ ] T034 Ensure all implementation guidance includes proper validation and best practices.

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 must be completed before Phase 2.
- Phase 2 must be completed before Phase 3.
- Phase 3 tasks can be executed in parallel where marked with [P].
- Phase 4 can begin after Phase 3 is substantially complete.

## Parallel Execution Examples (User Story 1)
- `T018`: Document dashboard implementation
- `T023`: Document control interface
- `T025`: Document data visualization

## Suggested MVP Scope
For an initial MVP, focus on completing Phase 1, Phase 2, and all tasks within Phase 3 (User Story 1). This will provide a comprehensive core understanding of UI/UX for technical applications.
