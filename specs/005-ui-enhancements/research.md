# Research Notes: Module 4: Advanced UI/UX Design for Robotics Applications

**Feature**: `005-ui-enhancements` | **Date**: 2025-12-11

## Phase 0: Research Summary

### Primary Goal
Create a comprehensive module that teaches advanced UI/UX design principles specifically for robotics applications.

### Key Research Areas
1. Human-robot interaction (HRI) principles and guidelines
2. UI patterns specific to robotics applications
3. Real-time data visualization techniques
4. Accessibility considerations for technical interfaces
5. Responsive design for robotics control systems

### Existing Resources Consulted
- Human-robot interaction research papers
- UI/UX design guidelines for technical systems
- ROS/ROS2 visualization tools documentation
- Accessibility standards (WCAG) for technical interfaces
- Industrial design principles

## Phase 1: Design Decisions

### Technology Stack
- React/TypeScript for implementation examples
- D3.js for data visualization
- Standard web technologies (HTML/CSS) for UI components

### Content Structure Decision
Organized as a Docusaurus-optimized module with design principles followed by practical implementation examples.

## Phase 2: Implementation Approach

### User Story Prioritization
- Focus on P1 (core UI/UX fundamentals for robotics) as the MVP
- Progress to advanced topics in sequence
