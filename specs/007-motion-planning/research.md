**Feature**: `007-motion-planning` | **Date**: 2025-12-11

## Phase 0: Research Summary

### Primary Goal
Create a comprehensive, technically-rich module that teaches motion planning algorithms including A*, RRT, PRM, and trajectory optimization techniques.

### Key Research Areas
1. Classical pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, JPS)
2. Sample-based planning (RRT, PRM, RRT*)
3. Trajectory optimization techniques
4. Collision detection algorithms
5. Configuration space representations
6. Performance analysis of different algorithms

### Existing Resources Consulted
- Robotics: Planning, Vision and Control textbook
- OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library) documentation
- Research papers on motion planning algorithms
- Algorithm implementation tutorials
- Performance benchmarking studies

## Phase 1: Design Decisions

### Technology Stack
- Python for algorithm implementation examples
- C++ for performance-critical examples
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- NumPy for computation

### Content Structure Decision
Organized as a Docusaurus-optimized module with classical algorithms foundation followed by sample-based approaches and optimization techniques.

## Phase 2: Implementation Approach

### User Story Prioritization
- Focus on P1 (core motion planning fundamentals) as the MVP
- Progress to advanced topics in sequence
