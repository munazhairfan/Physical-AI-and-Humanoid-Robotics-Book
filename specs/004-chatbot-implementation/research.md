**Feature**: `004-chatbot-implementation` | **Date**: 2025-12-11

## Phase 0: Research Summary

### Primary Goal
Create a comprehensive, technically-rich module that teaches how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot system.

### Key Research Areas
1. RAG architecture patterns and best practices
2. Vector database technologies (Chroma, Pinecone, FAISS)
3. Embedding models and strategies
4. Conversation management in RAG systems
5. Performance optimization techniques

### Existing Resources Consulted
- LangChain documentation
- LlamaIndex documentation
- Vector database comparison studies
- RAG system architecture papers

## Phase 1: Design Decisions

### Technology Stack
- Python for implementation examples
- LangChain/LlamaIndex for RAG frameworks
- Various vector databases for comparison

### Content Structure Decision
Organized as a Docusaurus-optimized module with theoretical concepts followed by practical examples.

## Phase 2: Implementation Approach

### User Story Prioritization
- Focus on P1 (core RAG fundamentals) as the MVP
- Progress to advanced topics in sequence
