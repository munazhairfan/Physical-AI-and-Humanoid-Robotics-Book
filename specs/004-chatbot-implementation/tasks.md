# Tasks for RAG Chatbot Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `004-chatbot-implementation` | **Date**: 2025-12-11 | **Spec**: D:/AI/Hackathon-I/Physical-AI-and-Humanoid-Robotics/specs/004-chatbot-implementation/spec.md
**Plan**: D:/AI/Hackathon-I/Physical-AI-and-Humanoid-Robotics/specs/004-chatbot-implementation/plan.md

## Summary
This document outlines the detailed, actionable tasks for developing specification content for RAG chatbot implementation, following the content requirements specified in `spec.md` and `plan.md`.

## Implementation Strategy
The implementation will follow an MVP-first approach, focusing on delivering core content for User Story 1, then progressively adding practical examples, and cross-cutting concerns. Each user story will be developed as an independently testable increment.

## Phase 1: Setup - Project Initialization
- [ ] T001 Initialize specification project structure
- [ ] T002 Set up research environment for RAG systems

## Phase 2: Foundational - Core Content Structure
- [ ] T003 Create core specification sections with proper structure
- [ ] T004 Document RAG architecture and components
- [ ] T005 Document vector databases and embedding models

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Learning RAG Fundamentals (P1)
**Goal**: User can identify core RAG components, understand architecture, compare traditional vs RAG systems, and implement basic document ingestion.

**Independent Test Criteria**: All content pages for RAG fundamentals are generated, formatted correctly, include explanations, Python code examples where applicable.

- [ ] T006 [US1] Add "What RAG is and why it is crucial for intelligent systems" content
- [ ] T007 [US1] Add "Comparison: Traditional chatbots → RAG systems" content
- [ ] T008 [US1] Add "Real-world applications" content
- [ ] T009 [US1] Add "RAG in enterprise and academic contexts" content
- [ ] T010 [US1] Add "RAG system architecture overview" content
- [ ] T011 [US1] Add "Data ingestion pipeline" overview
- [ ] T012 [US1] Add "Vector databases (Chroma, Pinecone, FAISS)" comparison
- [ ] T013 [US1] Add "Embedding models (OpenAI, SentenceTransformers, Hugging Face)" explanation
- [ ] T014 [US1] Add "Query processing and retrieval mechanisms" explanation
- [ ] T015 [US1] Add "Response generation and synthesis" explanation
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add "Document chunking strategies" explanation with Python example
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add "Embedding generation and storage" explanation with Python example
- [ ] T018 [P] [US1] Document basic RAG implementation with step-by-step instructions and Python code
- [ ] T019 [US1] Add "Similarity search algorithms" explanation with basic example
- [ ] T020 [US1] Add "Context window management" explanation with basic example
- [ ] T021 [US1] Add "Prompt engineering for RAG systems" explanation and example
- [ ] T022 [US1] Add "Memory and conversation history management" explanation and example
- [ ] T023 [P] [US1] Document advanced query processing with step-by-step instructions and Python code
- [ ] T024 [US1] Add "Multi-modal document processing" explanation and example
- [ ] T025 [P] [US1] Document evaluation metrics with step-by-step instructions and Python code
- [ ] T026 [US1] Add "Performance optimization techniques" explanation and example

## Phase 4: Final Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
- [ ] T027 Review all specification files for proper structure, learning objectives, and code/explanation.
- [ ] T028 Validate all code examples are runnable and produce expected outputs.
- [ ] T029 Review the overall tone and style of the specification content to ensure it is balanced, beginner-friendly, intuitive, and accurate.
- [ ] T030 Ensure all implementation guidance includes proper validation and best practices.

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 must be completed before Phase 2.
- Phase 2 must be completed before Phase 3.
- Phase 3 tasks can be executed in parallel where marked with [P].
- Phase 4 can begin after Phase 3 is substantially complete.

## Parallel Execution Examples (User Story 1)
- `T018`: Document basic RAG implementation
- `T023`: Document advanced query processing
- `T025`: Document evaluation metrics

## Suggested MVP Scope
For an initial MVP, focus on completing Phase 1, Phase 2, and all tasks within Phase 3 (User Story 1). This will provide a comprehensive core understanding of RAG systems.
