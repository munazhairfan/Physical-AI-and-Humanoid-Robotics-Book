# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS2)

     **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
     **Created**: 2025-12-04
     **Feature**: [D:/AI/Hackathon-I/Physical-AI-and-Humanoid-Robotics/specs/002-ros2-module/spec.md](D:/AI/Hackatho
  n-I/Physical-AI-and-Humanoid-Robotics/specs/002-ros2-module/spec.md)

     ## Content Quality
     - [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
     - [x] Focused on user value and business needs
     - [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
     - [x] All mandatory sections completed

     ## Requirement Completeness
     - [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
     - [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
     - [x] Success criteria are measurable
     - [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
     - [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
     - [x] Edge cases are identified
     - [x] Scope is clearly bounded
     - [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

     ## Feature Readiness
     - [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
     - [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
     - [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
     - [x] No implementation details leak into specification

     ## Notes
     - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
     - **Justification for implementation details**: The specification defines a content module for ROS2, which
  inherently involves specific technologies (ROS2, Docusaurus, Python, C++, Mermaid). These are not general
  implementation choices but rather the subject matter and required output format of the module itself, hence their
  inclusion is necessary and justified.
