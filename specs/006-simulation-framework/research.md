# Research Notes: Module 5: Robotics Simulation Frameworks (Gazebo, Webots, PyBullet)

**Feature**: `006-simulation-framework` | **Date**: 2025-12-11

## Phase 0: Research Summary

### Primary Goal
Create a comprehensive, technically-rich module that teaches robotics simulation frameworks including Gazebo, Webots, and PyBullet.

### Key Research Areas
1. Physics engine characteristics and comparison
2. Gazebo architecture and plugin system
3. Webots node system and PROTO files
4. PyBullet Python API and constraint solving
5. Sensor simulation techniques
6. Multi-robot simulation patterns

### Existing Resources Consulted
- Gazebo documentation and tutorials
- Webots user guide and API reference
- PyBullet examples and documentation
- ROS/ROS2 simulation tutorials
- Physics simulation research papers

## Phase 1: Design Decisions

### Technology Stack
- Python for PyBullet examples
- C++ for Gazebo plugins
- XML for URDF/SDF models
- Bash for simulation environment setup

### Content Structure Decision
Organized as a Docusaurus-optimized module with simulation fundamentals followed by framework-specific content and practical examples.

## Phase 2: Implementation Approach

### User Story Prioritization
- Focus on P1 (core simulation fundamentals) as the MVP
- Progress to framework-specific topics in sequence
