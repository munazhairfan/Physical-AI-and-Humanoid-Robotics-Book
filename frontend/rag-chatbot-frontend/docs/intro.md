## Key Topics

### Physical AI
Physical AI combines artificial intelligence with physical systems to create intelligent agents that can interact with the real world through perception, reasoning, and action. Key aspects include:
- Real-time processing requirements
- Handling uncertain environments
- Integration with multi-modal sensing systems
- Robust control under uncertainty

### Humanoid Robotics
Humanoid robots are designed to mimic human form and behavior, featuring a head, torso, two arms, and two legs to operate in human-designed environments. Key components include:
- Kinematics and dynamics for movement
- Balance and locomotion systems
- Whole-body control architectures
- Human-robot interaction capabilities

### RAG System
This system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide accurate answers based on the robotics textbook content, combining:
- Vector databases for efficient information retrieval
- Large language models for natural language understanding
- Context-aware response generation
- Real-time knowledge access
