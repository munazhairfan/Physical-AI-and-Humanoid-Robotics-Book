# Create Simulation Framework Task Breakdown

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Created comprehensive task breakdown for Module 5: Robotics Simulation Frameworks with 49 specific tasks organized across 5 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks)
- Phase 2: Foundational (9 tasks)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Learning simulation fundamentals (32 tasks)
- Phase 4: Final polish and cross-cutting concerns (5 tasks)

Tasks follow the required format with proper IDs, user story labels, and file paths. Identified parallel execution opportunities for framework-specific examples and diagram development. Each user story is designed to be independently testable.

## Outcome

Task breakdown complete with all 49 tasks properly formatted and organized. Ready for implementation phase.
