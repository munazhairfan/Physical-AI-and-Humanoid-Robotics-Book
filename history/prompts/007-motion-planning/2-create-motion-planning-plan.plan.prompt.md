# Create Motion Planning Plan

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 6: Motion Planning Algorithms including:

- Technical context with Python/C++ stack details for algorithm implementations
- Research findings on motion planning algorithms and their properties
- Data model for motion planning system entities (Environment, Path, Node, etc.)
- Quickstart guide for algorithm development environment
- Component contracts for planning interfaces

The plan addresses all requirements from the feature specification:
- Docusaurus-optimized content structure for module-6
- Algorithm implementation with Python and C++
- Visualization techniques for algorithm execution
- Configuration space representations and collision detection
- Performance analysis and optimization methods

## Outcome

Implementation plan complete with all Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts. Ready for task breakdown phase.
