# Create Motion Planning Task Breakdown

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Created comprehensive task breakdown for Module 6: Motion Planning Algorithms with 50 specific tasks organized across 5 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks)
- Phase 2: Foundational (9 tasks)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Learning motion planning fundamentals (34 tasks)
- Phase 4: Final polish and cross-cutting concerns (4 tasks)

Tasks follow the required format with proper IDs, user story labels, and file paths. Identified parallel execution opportunities for algorithm implementation examples and visualization development. Each user story is designed to be independently testable.

## Outcome

Task breakdown complete with all 50 tasks properly formatted and organized. Ready for implementation phase.
