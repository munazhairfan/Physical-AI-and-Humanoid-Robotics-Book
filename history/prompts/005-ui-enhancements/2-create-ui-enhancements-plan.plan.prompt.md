# Create UI Enhancements Plan

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 4: Advanced UI/UX Design for Robotics Applications including:

- Technical context with React/TypeScript and D3.js stack details for UI systems
- Research findings on HRI principles and robotics UI patterns
- Data model for robotics UI system entities (Robot Status, UI Component, Dashboard, etc.)
- Quickstart guide for UI/UX development environment
- Component contracts for UI elements and interfaces

The plan addresses all requirements from the feature specification:
- Docusaurus-optimized content structure for module-4
- React/TypeScript implementation with D3.js visualization
- Human-robot interaction design principles
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG standards
- Visual assets and mockups for robotics applications

## Outcome

Implementation plan complete with all Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts. Ready for task breakdown phase.
