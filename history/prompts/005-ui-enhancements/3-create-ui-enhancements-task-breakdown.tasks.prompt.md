## Response

Created comprehensive task breakdown for Module 4: Advanced UI/UX Design for Robotics Applications with 56 specific tasks organized across 6 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (6 tasks)
- Phase 2: Foundational (8 tasks)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Learning UI/UX fundamentals (30 tasks)
- Phase 4: Assets & visual resources (6 tasks)
- Phase 5: Polish and cross-cutting concerns (6 tasks)

Tasks follow the required format with proper IDs, user story labels, and file paths. Identified parallel execution opportunities for example creation and visual asset development. Each user story is designed to be independently testable.

## Outcome

Task breakdown complete with all 56 tasks properly formatted and organized. Ready for implementation phase.
