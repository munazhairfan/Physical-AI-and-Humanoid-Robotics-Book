# Preface

## Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics*, a comprehensive textbook designed to provide a deep understanding of the intersection between artificial intelligence and physical robotic systems. This book explores the cutting-edge field of embodied intelligence, where AI algorithms are tightly integrated with physical hardware to create systems capable of intelligent interaction with the real world.

### Book Organization

This textbook is organized into modular sections, each building upon the previous to provide a comprehensive understanding of physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1: Perception & Computer Vision** - Foundations of visual perception and computer vision techniques for robotics
- **Module 2: Robotic Nervous System (ROS2)** - Understanding the middleware and communication systems for robotic applications
- **Module 3: AI Perception & Sensor Fusion** - Advanced perception techniques and sensor integration
- **Module 4: Motion Planning & Control** - Algorithms for robot motion planning, path planning, trajectory generation, and control systems

Each module is designed to be self-contained while maintaining strong connections to other modules, allowing for flexible learning paths based on your specific interests and needs.

### Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Graduate students and advanced undergraduates in robotics, AI, and computer science
- Researchers working in embodied intelligence and humanoid robotics
- Engineers developing robotic systems
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and physical systems

### Prerequisites

Readers should have:
- Basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with programming concepts (preferably Python and C++)
