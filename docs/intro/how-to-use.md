# How to Use This Book

## Introduction

This guide will help you navigate and make the most of the *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* textbook. The book is designed with a modular structure that allows for flexible learning paths while maintaining comprehensive coverage of the subject matter.

## Book Structure

### Modular Design

The textbook is organized into distinct modules:

1. **Module 1: Perception & Computer Vision** - Focuses on visual perception and computer vision techniques
2. **Module 2: Robotic Nervous System (ROS2)** - Covers ROS2 framework and robotic communication systems
3. **Module 3: AI Perception & Sensor Fusion** - Explores advanced perception and sensor integration
4. **Module 4: Motion Planning & Control** - Covers motion planning algorithms and control systems

### Page Types

Each module contains several types of pages:

- **Overview**: Introduces the main concepts and learning objectives
- **Core Concepts**: Dives deep into fundamental principles
- **Architecture**: Explains system design and organization
- **Algorithms**: Details specific algorithms and implementations
- **Examples**: Practical implementations with code
- **Assignments**: Exercises to reinforce learning
- **Summary**: Key takeaways and connections to other modules

## Navigation

### Sequential Learning

For comprehensive understanding, we recommend following the modules in order:

1. Start with Module 1 to build foundational perception skills
2. Move to Module 2 to understand robotic communication
3. Proceed to Module 3 for advanced perception techniques
4. Complete with Module 4 for motion planning and control

### Targeted Learning

If you have specific interests or time constraints:

- **Perception-focused**: Modules 1 and 3
- **Systems-focused**: Modules 2 and 4
- **AI-focused**: Modules 3 and 4
- **Complete beginners**: All modules in sequence

### Cross-Module References

Look for links like [Module 1: Core Concepts](../module-1/core-concepts) and [Module 3: Sensor Fusion](../module-3/fusion-techniques) to explore related content across modules.

## Learning Approach

### Active Learning

- Read each section carefully
- Work through code examples
- Complete assignments to reinforce concepts
- Use the RAG chatbot for additional questions

### Practical Application

- Implement code examples in your environment
- Experiment with different parameters
- Connect concepts to real-world applications
- Build on examples to create your own solutions

## Resources

### Code Examples

All code examples are provided in Python and C++ with clear explanations and expected outputs.

### Diagrams

Mermaid diagrams and other visualizations help clarify complex concepts and system architectures.

### Assignments

Each module includes assignments with:
- Clear instructions
- Expected outputs
- Validation checkpoints
- Hints for challenging problems

## Getting Help

### RAG Chatbot

Use the integrated RAG chatbot to ask questions about specific concepts, get clarifications, or explore connections between modules.

### References

Consult the reference section for additional reading materials, research papers, and documentation.

## Progress Tracking

### Learning Objectives

Each section begins with clear learning objectives to guide your study.

### Self-Assessment

Use the assignments and examples to assess your understanding of key concepts.

## Technical Requirements
