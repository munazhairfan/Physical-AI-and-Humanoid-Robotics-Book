# Module 3: AI Perception & Sensor Fusion

## Introduction

Welcome to the AI Perception & Sensor Fusion module. This module explores the fundamental concepts, algorithms, and practical implementations of artificial intelligence-based perception systems in robotics. You'll learn how robots can understand their environment through various sensors and how to combine data from multiple sensors to create a robust perception system.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the core principles of AI perception in robotics
- Identify and describe different sensor types and their characteristics
- Implement basic and advanced sensor fusion algorithms
- Apply perception techniques to real-world robotic scenarios
- Design multi-sensor perception systems for robotic platforms
